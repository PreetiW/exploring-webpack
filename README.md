# Exploring webpack


## Why webpack



## Module Federation

Module federation allows one application to dynamically load modules for another applications at runtime.

This feature was introduced in webpack 5


### How it is done?

* update webpack config to expose the fed module
* public path
* dynamic imports
* import AppName/ComponentName
* default export
* use the component as it was defined in your application
* check network tab of developer tools to see which files are loaded at runtime
